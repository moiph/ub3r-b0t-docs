# Learn all about me

Everything you want and don't want to know about UB3R-B0T

> [!WARNING]
> This bot is a bit of an asshat. A loveable asshat, but nonetheless he's often sassy and rude. Anytime I've tried to improve his personality he just spits capacitors in my face.

## The Commands

There are quite a few commands. Some are legitimately useful (like reminders). Some are useless (like the votekick command). Some are fun (like the beer command).

Find the full reference of commands here: [The commands](commands.md)


## Configuration

Once UB3R-B0T has been added to your server, there are a number of ways you can configure the bot to suit your server.
You can:
- Disable certain commands you dislike. Like the Chuck Norris command because it's dated or the FML command because it's been broken for years?
- Set greetings/farewells for when users join/leave
- Disable silly auto responses
- Add your OWN silly auto responses
- Customize the command prefix (ugh no stahp default maintains consistency)
- Setup word censors
- Look at a page of quotes that you can't act upon because I'm a lazy ass and haven't finished the quote management portal
- Configure Notifications (see below)


## Notifications

UB3R-B0T supports notifications from various sources:
- Bluesky
- Picarto

Configuration of each type can be done in the [Admin panel](https://ub3r-b0t.com/admin)

Ugh I hate upselling but if you wanna join the [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/ub3rb0t) thing you get perks like higher limits on notification types and you can feel special.


## Reporting issues

You can use the `feedback` command for general feedback or suggestions. For more technical issues you can file something on the main project page: [https://github.com/moiph/ub3r-b0t](https://github.com/moiph/ub3r-b0t)

Prove you at least read some of the documentation by saying "A Møøse once bit my sister"
We'll be nicer knowing you manged to read.
