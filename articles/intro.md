# Learn all about me

Everything you want and don't want to know about UB3R-B0T

> [!WARNING]
> This bot is a bit of an asshat. A loveable asshat, but nonetheless he's often sassy and rude. Anytime I've tried to improve his personality he just spits capacitors in my face.

## The Commands

There are quite a few commands. Some are legitimately useful (like reminders). Some are useless (like the votekick command). Some are fun (like the beer command).

Find the full reference of commands here: [The commands](commands.md)


## Configuration

Once UB3R-B0T has been added to your server, there are a number of ways you can configure the bot to suit your server.
You can:

- Set greetings/farewells for when users join/leave
- Disable silly auto responses
- Add your OWN silly auto responses
- Customize the command prefix (ugh no stahp default maintains consistency)
- Setup word censors
- Manage quotes
- Configure Notifications (see below)
