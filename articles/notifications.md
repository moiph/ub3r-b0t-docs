# Notifications

Everyone loves notifications right? UB3R-B0T supports notifications from various sources:

- Bluesky
- Picarto
- RSS
- Twitch

Configuring these can be done in the [Admin panel](https://ub3r-b0t.com/admin).
There you can add a user or feed for each type, and specify what channel you want notifiations to be pushed to.

## RSS
A commonly asked question is "How do I setup notification for a YouTube channel?"
See http://blog.markheadrick.com/2016/05/12/how-to-get-a-youtube-channels-rss-feed/ for how to get the feed URL, and add it into the RSS notifications section in the admin panel.

## Limits
The max number of noitification subscriptions is 10 per type, but that limit is upped to 30 for patreon subscribers.
