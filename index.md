# The hell is an UB3R-B0T?

UB3R-B0T is primarily a utility bot. He's also a bit grumpy because he's a 20 year old IRC bot and will show it in some of his responses. But with age, comes wisdom. Maybe.

## Adding UB3R-B0T to your server

#### On Discord
Oh man this is the easiest part you literally just click this [Invite link](https://ub3r-b0t.com/invite) and he'll join your server once you authorize it.

#### On IRC or Twitch
Okay well this part isn't self service you have to go ping moiph on Discord and request this one.

> [!NOTE]
> This is not an IRC/Discord relay bot. It's standalone per platform.
